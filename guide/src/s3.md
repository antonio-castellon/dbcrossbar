# S3

Amazon's [S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a bucket-based system for storing data in the cloud.

## Example locators

Source locators:

- `s3://bucket/dir/file.csv`
- `s3://bucket/dir/`

Destination locators:

- `s3://bucket/dir/`

At this point, we do not support single-file output to a cloud bucket. This is relatively easy to add, but has not yet been implemented.

## Configuration & authentication

The following environment variables are used to authenticate:

- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` (required): The ID for your AWS credentials.
- `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (required): The secret part of your AWS credentials.
- `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` (optional): Set this to use temporary AWS crdentials.
- `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` (required): Set this to your AWS region.
