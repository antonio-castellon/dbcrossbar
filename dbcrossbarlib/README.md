# dbcrossbarlib: Translate table schemas and copy tables between databases

This is currently an internal library used by [`dbcrossbar`][dbcrossbar], and it has an unstable API. We might someday decide to stabilize this as a public API that performs the same operations as the `dbcrossbar` CLI. It is not yet intended for use outside of that tool, and it may not always respect Semantic Versioning rules.
