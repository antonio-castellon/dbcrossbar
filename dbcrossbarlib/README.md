# dbcrossbarlib: Translate table schemas and copy tables between databases

This is currently an internal library used by [`dbcrossbar`][dbcrossbar], and it has an unstable API. We might someday decide to stabilize this as a public API that performs the same operations as the `dbcrossbar` CLI.

Note that this requires a specific version of nightly Rust to build. See the [rust-toolchain][] file for the current version.
